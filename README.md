# Welcome to my GitHub profile! :wave:

I'm excited to showcase my technical skills with Tailwind CSS and Vue.js 3. I've been working on a project that demonstrates my proficiency with these technologies.

The project is a web app built with Vue.js 3 and styled with Tailwind CSS. It allows users to create and manage tasks, with features such as drag and drop reordering, filtering, and sorting.

Thank you for stopping by, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or feedback.
